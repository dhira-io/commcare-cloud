## Change Context
Copy data from `supply_point` field to `location` field in `Invitation` model to prevent errors with
future migrations to the `users_invitation` table.

This operation is required for all environment regardless of feature usage.

to `SQLLocation`. This migration is to prepare for that transition.

$ commcare-cloud <env> django-manage --tmux copy_invitation_supply_point
```

Precautions:
* No downtime is needed for this operation however it is best to run the command during a period
  of low traffic.
